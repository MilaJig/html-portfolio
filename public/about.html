<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Mila once accidentally reverse-engineered the Matrix while trying
   to automate her morning coffee. A retired intergalactic 3D wizard,
    she now spends her time taming Blender scripts, interrogating
    polygons, and whispering sweet nothings to rogue Go routines.
    With a degree in Econometrics and a PhD in Guessing What Broke
    This Time™, Mila thrives on solving complex problems, especially
    the ones she caused herself. When she’s not debugging reality,
    she enjoys long walks through vertex forests and casual
    conversations with AI.</p>
